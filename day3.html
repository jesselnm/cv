  <h1>Day 3</h1>
  <h2>12 November 2020</h2>
  <p style="font-style:20px">I am enjoying myself so far even though it's only been a couple of days. Each lesson conducted by Dr. Yu is very informative <br>
    and easy to digest. She uses the watch-first-then-try method to teach, which I feel is much more effective and efficient than code-alongs.
    <br><br>
    Here's what I learned within an hour after work:
    <ul>
      <li>More on tables, eg: Nested Tables</li>
      <li>Creating multiple links that redirects user to one of my sub pages</li>
      <li>HTML Forms that requires user's information.</li>
    </ul>
