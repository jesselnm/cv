  <h1>Day 1</h1>
  <h2>10 November 2020</h2>
  <p style="font-size:20px">Just a quick background of myself.</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px">I studied Diploma in Computer Engineering in Polytechnic. I only began to realise it was more of hardware <br>
    than software. I realised it wasn't something that's for me. Learning about computers and how things work was cool and stuff but <br>
    deep inside I just knew it wasn't for me. Then, there was one semester where I took a basic programming class using C++ and I loved it. <br>
    <br>After graduating, I began my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore#:~:text=National%20Service%20(NS)%20is%20the,service%20in%20the%20uniformed%20services." target="_blank">National Service</a> ; a mandatory, 2
    year full-time service in the Singapore Police Force.
    <br>4 months since my enlisting into the Force, I was interested in being a Software Engineering as a career after my service. So I picked up <br>
    a Python course on Udemy. I only managed to complete the pure basics section of the course and that's where I just suddenly lost interest. <br>
    THe reason behind that was probably because I didn't know specifically what kind of Software Engineering suits me. Or maybe Python just seemed
    <br>too daunting for a noob like me.
    <br><br>So, months later, I came across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB4bSDznwgM" target="_blank">video</a> on my reccomended page on YouTube.
    <br>After watching the video, I researched a little on other people's portfolios and found them to be very <em>cool</em>. I didn't want to expect much
    <br>so I dove straight into the world of Web Development. Making aesthetically pleasing and intuitive websites makes me feel excited to learn more about
    <br>Web Development.<br><br>Now, here I am, officially starting my journey as a self-taught Web Developer, Currently in a course called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=WebDevelopment_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.ROW_ti.8322&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_80385735315_._ad_437497334061_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-774930035449_._li_9062543_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=Cj0KCQiAnb79BRDgARIsAOVbhRrHxjGLZrfeQDwy4I5n4eQF1LDzbibjb0TzlcH-Q9qOKZFVnkMwCS4aAnFXEALw_wcB" target="_blank">The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu</a> and so far, it's going great!
